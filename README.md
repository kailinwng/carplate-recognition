# Car Plate Extraction and Recognition Program

## Overview
This project is a MATLAB-based program designed to extract car number plates from images using image processing techniques and subsequently recognize characters on those plates using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.

## Features
### Plate Extraction: 
Uses image processing methods such as edge detection, thresholding, and morphological operations to isolate and extract license plates from images.
### Character Recognition: 
Implements SVM for recognizing characters on extracted plates. SVM is trained on a dataset of characters to classify and decode characters accurately.

## Requirements
MATLAB, 

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
3. Ensure all dependencies like the character training images are downloaded.
4. Modify the file path in main.m to point to the image file you want to process.
5. Run the file to start the program.

## Notes
This program assumes clear and well-aligned images of car license plates.
Performance may vary based on image quality, lighting conditions, and plate orientation.
Adjust image pre-processing parameters as needed for optimal results.
